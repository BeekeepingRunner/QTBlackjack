# QTBlackjack

Blackjack - My first Qt Widget app, a game created with the aim of the university course credit.

Based on a task from a c++ tutorial which can be found here:
https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/6-x-chapter-6-comprehensive-quiz/.

I modified this task to be an object oriented solution and compatible with QT.
